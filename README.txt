----------------------------------- PROJECT INVENTOR ----------------------------------- 

	The main goal of this project is to contribute to Salesianos on it's warehouse
logistics in order to improve their efficiency.

	On this repository are our programme to import the data from their former Lotus
Notes Database, the schema of our database and the source code of our WebApp. The idea
is to write the backend of the app in PHP, but in order to learn a bit more there will 
be more backend files writen in Ruby on Rails.
